Kuwait, my country, may you be safe and glorious!
May you always enjoy good fortune!
You are the cradle of my ancestors,
Who put down its memory.
With everlasting symmetry, showing all eternity,
Those Arabs were heavenly,
Kuwait, my country,
May you be safe and glorious!
May you always enjoy good fortune.
Blessed be my Country a homeland for harmony,
Warded by true sentry giving their soils aptly,
Building high its history, Kuwait,
My country, we're for you my Country,
Led by faith and loyalty,
With its Amir equally,
Fencing us all fairly, with warm love and verity,
Kuwait, my country,
May you be safe and glorious.
May you always enjoy good fortune!
